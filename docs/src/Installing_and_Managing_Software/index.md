> 3. [Homebrew](Homebrew.md) - Install applications intended to run inside of the terminal.
> 4. [Distrobox](Distrobox.md) - Intended for legacy applications that do not support Flatpak and Homebrew, or for use as development boxes.
> 5. [AppImage](AppImage.md) - Portable universal package format that relies on specific host libraries at a system-level.
> 6. [`rpm-ostree`](rpm-ostree.md) - Layer Fedora packages at a system-level (**not recommended, use as a last resort**)!
